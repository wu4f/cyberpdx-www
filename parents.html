<h2>Information for Students and Parents</h2>

<h3>Participants</h3><p>CyberPDX is a partnership between PSU and high schools in Oregon and Washington.  We invite applications from interested high schools. Ten high schools will take part in the camp.  Each school will send a team of 6 students and 2 teachers.  Students will be selected by teachers at their high school. </p>

<h3>What happens at CyberPDX?</h3><p>  Each day has activities for all three threads in the curriculum (cybersecurity principles and practices; cybersecurity history and policy, and technology and the arts).  Activities are scheduled from breakfast to bedtime, including classwork (lessons and demonstrations), teamwork (problem-sets, role-playing, shooting and editing video), film screenings, and downtime.  Camp ends with three team projects: a cyber-summit policy debate, a student film festival, and a ﬁnal cyber challenge.  </p>

<h3>Where will students stay at camp?</h3><p>   Students and teachers will have adjoining rooms in the Ondine residence hall. Students and teachers will be provided meals in the dorm dining hall. Students share double-rooms which include desks and private bath.  Teachers have single rooms. Each team will also have their own group room to work on prohjects.  </p>

<h3>What does it cost?</h3><p>  There is no cost for students to participate in the CyberPDX camp – other than for transportation to and from PSU for the camp.  Instruction, room, and board for students and teachers will be paid for by funding from the National Science Foundation and the National Security Agency.   Donor funds support the banquet and teacher workshops.</p>

<h3>How can my high school connect with CyberPDX?</h3><p>   CyberPDX is a professional development program for high school teachers, developed with an eye to strengthening cyber education in Oregon and Washington.  High schools can apply to send a team to CyberPDX if they have an administrator (principal or other designated person) who will support and facilitate the team, a teacher who teaches one or more STEM subjects and a teacher who teaches topics in the arts, humanities, and social sciences.</p>
